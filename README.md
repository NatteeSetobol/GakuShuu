# GakuShuu


Gakujuu (学習) which means "learn" or "studying" in Japanese, is a flashcard for the iOS that uses the SRS (spaced repetition system) system to help memorize Kanjis/Words. It will feature Kanji/Word from Japanese Proficiency four, three, two and one. It will also let you add and look up Kanjis/Words and add them to a deck.


# How to compile and run

In order to compile and run this, you must have XCode 13.1.


#Bugs:

1. Words/Kanji with ~ are empty.

#Future features:

1. Undo (sometimes you press the wrong button)
2. Voice to text (So you can actually hear how it's pronouced)
3. Dictionary Search + Add to Deck. (Great if you reading something and need to keep track of words you don't know!)
4. Better search.
5. Status on how you are doing.
6. Suspend Card (if you no longer need to memorize a kanji or if you don't feel this Kanji or word isn't as important)
