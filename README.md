# GakuShuu


Gakujuu (学習) which means "learn" or "studying" in Japanese is a flashcard that uses the SRS (spaced repetition system) system to help memorize Kanji. 
The way I see SRS is like doing reps at the gym. For example, lets say you start with 20 pounds and every 5 mins you lift the 20 pounds of weight 10 times.
You then take a rest then repeat. The next day you up it, instead of 20 pounds you now do 25 pounds. It works the same way with your brain.
